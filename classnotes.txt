getwd() : get working directory
source("code.R")  : to load a function

everything is an object
Data types:
	char
	numeric
	integer
	complex
	logical
	
the most basic : vector --> but a homogeneous container

LIST --> heterogenous vector
empty vector --> vector()

Numbers: 
a numeric object
Inf --> stands for infinity, a special number
NaN --> not a number

Attributes:
	names, dimnames
	dimensions
	class
	length
	other user-defined attributes
	
	attributes() : a function
	
Assignment Operator :  x <- 1
Comments : ##

[1] : this indicates that the variable is a vector	

x <- 1:20

Creating vectors:
	the "c()" function
	the "vector()" function
	
	example  :  x <- c(1,2,3,4)
	
Mixing Objects (implicit coercion)
	y <- c(1.7,"a")
	
	--> in such cases, a simple coercion happens, and all the elements 
	are converted to a same type.
	
Explicit Coercion 
		x <- 0:6
		as.numeric(x);
		
Matrices :
	Nothing but a vector with the attribute DIMENSION
	examples : m <- matrix(1:6 , nrow = 2 , ncol = 3)

	VIMP : they get constructed column wise!!!!!
	
	You can convert a vector to a matrix by just giving it a dim() attribute
	m <- 1:10
	dim(m) <- c(2,5)
	
	
	cbind-ING and rbind-ING
	x <- 1:3
	y <- 4:6
	
	cbind(x,y) 
	rbind(x,y)
	
A LIST!!
	its like a vector of vectors!
	as it holds different data-types, each element is a vector of elements of that data-type
	symbol : [[1]]
